# How to Share Your Projects Online üöÄ

A quick tutorial on how to get your creative computing projects published online, so you can share them widely and also run them on different devices (outside of your local machine).

Want to show off your awesome p5.js or Teachable Machine projects? Super! Let‚Äôs get them online for the world to see. It‚Äôs easier than you think!

We will explore two free ways to achieve this, using **GitHub Pages** üìÑ and **Vercel** üåê. Both are great, but there are some differences:

---

## GitHub Pages vs. Vercel

> Use **GitHub Pages** is:
> - You‚Äôve got a static website or a project that only uses client-side code. üñºÔ∏è
> - Example: a gallery of your p5.js sketches or a personal portfolio.

---

> Use **Vercel** if:
> - Your project needs to do more complex tasks, like server-side processing, or you want to use advanced development features like serverless functions. üíª
> - Example: an interactive web app that uses Teachable Machine to classify images uploaded by users in real-time. (Vercel can also handle static websites, same as GitHub Pages).

# GitHub Pages

## 1: Tidy Up Your Project

- Make sure your project is stored on a GitHub repository, and the internal structure is clean.
- Have your main page called `index.html`.

## 2: Make It Live

- Jump into your project on GitHub, find the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab, then look for ‚ÄúPages‚Äù on the side menu.
- Pick the branch where your project lives (probably `main`). Hit "Save", and bam, you‚Äôre almost there.

## 3: Share Your Project

- GitHub gives you a special link. It looks like this: `https://yourusername.github.io/yourprojectname/`
- That‚Äôs it! Send this link to friends, family, or anyone you like.
- Because the project is now stored online you don't need your laptop to run it! This means you can run it on your phone, iPad, or whatever other device suits your project best.

# Vercel

## 1: Prep Your Project

- Your project should already be stored as a GitHub repository, make sure it's in good order and you have got a index page. We'll get Vercel connected to it over the next steps.

## 2: Sign Up to Vercel

- Head over to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and make an account (you can use GitHub login to make things faster).
- Once you are logged in, you should see your Vercel dashboard. It's still empty, but we'll add a new project in a second.

## 3: Bring in Your Project

- Click ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù, then find your project from GitHub and choose it.
- Most times, the magic settings Vercel has will work just fine.

## 4: Go Live

- Vercel does its thing and gives you a link to your live project.
- You can share this link with the world, or run your project on a separate device. Take your project out of your laptop and imagine new possibilities.

# You Did It! üéâ

Now you know how to get your projects out there for everyone to see. Whether it‚Äôs a simple site with GitHub Pages or something a bit more complex on Vercel, you‚Äôve got this. Don‚Äôt forget, sharing your work is a big step in showing the world what you can do.
